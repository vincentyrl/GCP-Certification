#SELECT
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` WHERE duration>=1200;



#GROUP BY
#The GROUP BY keyword will aggregate result-set rows that share common criteria (e.g. a column value) and will return all of the unique entries found for such criteria

SELECT start_station_name FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` GROUP BY start_station_name;

#COUNT
#The COUNT() function will return the number of rows that share the same criteria (e.g. column value). This can be very useful in tandem with a GROUP BY

SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(*) FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` GROUP BY start_station_name;

#AS
#SQL also has an AS keyword, which creates an alias of a table or column. An alias is a new name that's given to the returned column or tableâ€”whatever AS specifies.

SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(*) AS num_starts FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` GROUP BY start_station_name;
